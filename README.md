This is my first Discord bot, made in Python with [Pycord](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/)  

The bot can :  
- responds to "quoi" with "feur" :  
    - if it is the first time, you are written in database with your discord ID and 0 times, and each time you get pwned, this number increments  
- respond to slash command "feur" to see how many times you got pwned :  
    - also, if it is the first time, you are written in database with your discord ID and 0 times
